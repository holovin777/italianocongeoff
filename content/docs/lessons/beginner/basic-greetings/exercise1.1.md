# Exercise 1.1: Basic Greetings Practice

Welcome to your first exercise! It’s time to put those Italian greetings to the test. Don’t worry if you get some wrong – remember, even Italians sometimes mix up their greetings after an extra espresso! ☕ So, let’s dive in and have some fun.

---

### 1. Multiple Choice – What Would You Say?

Choose the correct Italian greeting for each scenario. (Hint: There's no option to "smile and wave," but that works too.)

1. You bump into a friend at 9 AM, and they look like they’re still half asleep. What do you say?
   - A) Buonasera
   - B) Ciao
   - C) Buonanotte

2. It’s 8 PM, and you’re trying to impress someone with your politeness. What do you say?
   - A) Buongiorno
   - B) Salve
   - C) Buonasera

3. You’re ready to hit the pillow and call it a night. How do you say "Goodnight" in Italian (without singing a lullaby)?
   - A) Buonanotte
   - B) Ciao
   - C) Buongiorno

### 2. Fill in the Blanks – Be the Italian Greeting Expert

Complete each sentence with the correct Italian greeting. Imagine you’re in each situation and respond as the expert greeter you’re becoming!

1. It’s 10 AM, and you see your neighbor in the hallway. You say, "**_____**."
   
2. You’re leaving a group of friends after an epic evening of pizza and laughs. You say, "**_____**."

3. You’re meeting someone for the first time, and you’re not quite sure if a handshake or a hug is coming. You play it safe and say, "**_____**."

### 3. Practice Dialogue – Time for Some Fun Italian Role-Play!

Complete the dialogue below using the correct greetings. (Feel free to add hand gestures – they’re 50% of Italian communication, after all.)

**Scenario**: You’re at an Italian café early in the morning, about to order a cappuccino.

- **You**: (say hello politely, because it’s early and caffeine hasn’t hit yet)
- **Barista**: Buongiorno! Desidera un caffè?
- **You**: Certo, grazie! (end the conversation with a friendly goodbye)

### 4. Match the Greetings – Who Says What?

Match each Italian greeting to its best use case. (Imagine you’re in Italy, and yes, you’re trying not to accidentally order a horse instead of a coffee!)

1. **Buongiorno**  
2. **Buonasera**  
3. **Buonanotte**  
4. **Ciao**  
5. **Salve**  

A) When you’re ready to say goodnight, without a lullaby.  
B) The all-purpose, casual “hello” for friends (and maybe pets).  
C) For greeting someone politely in the morning or afternoon.  
D) A polite hello when you’re not quite sure if a handshake or a hug is coming.  
E) The go-to greeting in the evening when you’re feeling a bit fancy.

### 5. Situational Humor – How Would You Greet?

Imagine yourself in each of these situations and decide what you’d say. (No pressure – even Italians wouldn’t mind if you mixed up a greeting or two.)

1. **Situation**: You’re meeting your friend’s grandma for the first time, and she’s giving you the *look* (you know the one). What’s your greeting?
   - Response: ___________________________

2. **Situation**: It’s midnight, and you’re finally ready to leave the party. You realize you’ve already said goodbye three times, but Italians love a grand exit. What’s your final word?
   - Response: ___________________________

3. **Situation**: You’re ordering coffee, and the barista looks like he’s had one too many espresso shots. He greets you with a big *Buongiorno!* – what’s your reply?
   - Response: ___________________________

### 6. Creative Exercise – Write Your Own Hilarious Dialogue

Imagine meeting an Italian friend in the afternoon and having a quick chat. Write your own dialogue using at least two greetings. Here’s a funny example:

**Example**:
- **You**: Ciao, amico mio! Quanta pizza hai mangiato oggi?
- **Friend**: Ciao! Solo una… o due… o tre fette! E tu?
- **You**: Buonasera, allora! Sembra che sia ora di una pausa pizza!

Enjoy these exercises and don’t stress – if you make a mistake, just say *oops* in Italian (hint: it’s still *oops*) and move on. Buona fortuna e buon divertimento! 🎉
