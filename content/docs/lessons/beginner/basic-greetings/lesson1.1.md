## The Core Italian Greetings  

| Greeting      | Meaning         | When to Use It                                    |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Ciao**      | Hi/Bye          | Informal. Use it with friends, family, and Viktor when heâ€™s in a relaxed neighborly mood. |
| **Buongiorno**| Good morning    | Formal or polite. Use it before 4 PM, especially when Viktor is on his way to work. |
| **Buonasera** | Good evening    | Formal or polite. Use it after 4 PMâ€”or earlier if Viktor invites you for aperitivo. |
| **Buonanotte**| Good night      | For saying goodbye at bedtime. Viktor once teased Geoff for using this after breakfast. |

## Dialogue with Viktor and Geoff  

**Scenario**: Geoff meets Viktor outside their apartment building in the morning to practice Italian greetings.  

- **Geoff**: Buongiorno, Viktor! *(Good morning, Viktor!)*  
- **Viktor**: Buongiorno, Geoff! Come stai? *(Good morning, Geoff! How are you?)*  
- **Geoff**: Bene, grazie! E tu? *(Good, thank you! And you?)*  
- **Viktor**: Tutto bene, grazie. Hai provato a salutare il barista oggi? *(All good, thanks. Did you try greeting the barista today?)*  
- **Geoff**: SÃ¬! Ho detto buongiorno, e lui ha sorriso! *(Yes! I said good morning, and he smiled!)*  
- **Viktor**: Bravo, Geoff. Ora sembri quasi italiano! *(Well done, Geoff. Now you almost seem Italian!)*  

*(Viktor chuckles, proud of Geoffâ€™s progress.)*

## Cultural Tips  

1. **Always Greet First**: Italians love greetings, so start every interaction with a warm *ciao* or *buongiorno*. Viktor will remind you if you forget.  
2. **Match the Formality**: Use *ciao* for informal situations and *buongiorno* or *buonasera* for formal ones. Viktor switches effortlessly, depending on whether heâ€™s chatting with Geoff or addressing his landlord.  
3. **Timing Matters**: Donâ€™t mix up *buonanotte* with *buonasera*. Viktor still laughs about the time Geoff said *buonanotte* at 2 PM.

## Practice Time  

Try these greetings out loud. Imagine Viktor smiling proudly as you practice:  

1. **Ciao, come stai?** *(Hi, how are you?)*  
2. **Buongiorno, mi chiamo Geoff.** *(Good morning, my name is Geoff.)*  
3. **Buonasera, piacere di conoscerti.** *(Good evening, nice to meet you.)*

## Fun Fact  

Viktor says Italians are masters of **non-verbal greetings**. A wave, a smile, or a quick nod can replace words entirely. But for now, Geoffâ€™s sticking to the wordsâ€”and Viktor is here to guide him.
