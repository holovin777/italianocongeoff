Welcome to your first step in mastering Italian! Greetings are more than just words—they’re the key to making connections, earning smiles, and avoiding awkward silences (especially when meeting someone’s *nonna* for the first time).

## What You’ll Learn  

In this section, we’ll cover:  
- The essential Italian greetings for any situation.  
- How to say hello in the morning, afternoon, and evening—because Italians like their greetings as specific as their coffee orders.  
- Polite vs. casual greetings—so you don’t accidentally say “Yo, what’s up?” to someone’s boss.

## Why It Matters  

Imagine this:  

- **Geoff** walks into a café and shouts, *"Ciao, tutti!"*  
- The crowd stares, bemused, because shouting “Hi, everyone!” isn’t the norm.  
- With the right greeting, Geoff could have ordered his cappuccino without turning redder than a ripe tomato.  

Knowing how to greet someone the Italian way is your gateway to blending in like a pro.
