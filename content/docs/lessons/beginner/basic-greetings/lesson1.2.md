# Lesson 1.2: Basic Farewells – Saying Goodbye in Italian 👋

In Lesson 1.1, you learned how to say hello and make a great first impression. Now, let’s learn how to end conversations just as smoothly with Italian farewells! Whether you’re saying goodbye to friends, family, or someone you just met, this lesson will guide you through the different ways to bid farewell in Italian.

### 1. Casual Goodbyes

When you’re with friends, family, or people you’re comfortable with, a casual goodbye works well. Here are the most common ones:

- **"Ciao"** – Just like “hello,” "Ciao" is also used to say “goodbye” in informal settings.
  - **Example**: "Ciao, ci vediamo domani!" (Bye, see you tomorrow!)

- **"A dopo"** – This means “See you later” and is often used when you expect to see the person soon.
  - **Example**: "A dopo!" (See you later!)

- **"A presto"** – This phrase means “See you soon” and works when you’ll see someone again soon, even if it’s not later that day.
  - **Example**: "Ciao, a presto!" (Bye, see you soon!)

### 2. Polite and Formal Goodbyes

In more formal situations, such as when speaking with strangers, older individuals, or in professional settings, Italians use more polite farewells. Here are some common ones:

- **"Arrivederci"** – A polite way to say “Goodbye” that works in both formal and informal situations.
  - **Example**: "Grazie mille, arrivederci!" (Thank you very much, goodbye!)

- **"Arrivederla"** – This is the ultra-polite version of “Goodbye,” often used in very formal contexts (like speaking to clients or elders).
  - **Example**: "Buona giornata, arrivederla." (Have a good day, goodbye.)

### 3. Time-Specific Farewells

Italians love greetings and farewells that match the time of day. Here’s how to say goodbye at different times:

- **"Buona giornata"** – This phrase means “Have a good day” and is commonly used when parting ways in the morning or early afternoon.
  - **Example**: "Ci vediamo! Buona giornata!" (See you later! Have a good day!)

- **"Buon pomeriggio"** – A rarer way to say “Good afternoon” when saying goodbye in the late afternoon. (Note: This one is less common, but good to know!)
  - **Example**: "Grazie, buon pomeriggio!" (Thank you, good afternoon!)

- **"Buona serata"** – This means “Have a good evening” and is used when parting in the evening, typically after 5 PM.
  - **Example**: "Buona serata a tutti!" (Good evening to everyone!)

- **"Buonanotte"** – Use this to say “Good night” when you’re leaving for the night, especially when everyone is heading to bed.
  - **Example**: "È tardi, vado a dormire. Buonanotte!" (It’s late, I’m going to sleep. Good night!)

> **Note**: Unlike "Buona serata," which is for the general evening, "Buonanotte" is specifically for the end of the day or when people are going to bed.
