Imagine this:

- **Viktor** (random passerby): *Sempre dritto, poi a sinistra!* *(Straight ahead, then left!)*  
- **Geoff**: *Grazie!* *(Thank you!)*  
(Viktor mutters: "Spero che capisca..." *I hope he understands...*)  

Getting directions right can mean the difference between discovering a beautiful hidden alleyway or ending up in a random parking lot.
