So, you’ve learned how to **order food** and **pay the bill**, but are you truly dining like an Italian? 🤌  

Italy has **unwritten food rules** that could **confuse tourists** (or get you judged by an old nonna at the next table). Let’s make sure you blend in and don’t commit a *cultural food crime*.

## What You’ll Learn

✅ Enjoy a meal without looking like a lost tourist.

## Dining Etiquette 101  

### ✅ **Do’s – How to Eat Like an Italian**  

🍝 **Follow the Meal Structure** – Italians eat in courses. You start with an *antipasto*, move to *primo* (pasta/risotto), then *secondo* (meat/fish), and finish with *dolce* (dessert).  

☕ **Drink Coffee Like an Italian** – Espresso is the king. Cappuccino is **only for breakfast**. Ordering one after dinner? A crime against coffee.  

🍞 **Expect Bread, But Not Butter** – Bread comes with meals, but **don’t ask for butter**. It’s meant to be eaten with your food, not as a starter.  

🍷 **Sip, Don’t Gulp** – Wine is to be enjoyed. If you drink it too fast, you might get a concerned look from Viktor.  

🧀 **Save Cheese for the Right Dish** – No, you can’t put **Parmesan on seafood pasta**. It’s an unwritten Italian law.  

---

### ❌ **Don’ts – Avoid These Tourist Mistakes**  

❌ **No Pineapple on Pizza** – Just… don’t. If you order a *pizza all’ananas*, Viktor might disown you.  

❌ **No Spaghetti Cutting** – Twirl your spaghetti, don’t cut it! Scissors are for paper, not pasta.  

❌ **No Rushing** – Italian meals are **slow** and meant to be enjoyed. If you eat too fast, the waiter won’t bring the bill… because they assume you’re staying for another two hours.  

❌ **No Extra Sauce Requests** – Italians take their pasta sauces seriously. Asking for ketchup with pasta? You might get exiled.  

❌ **No Sharing Bills Like a Spreadsheet** – Italians prefer one person paying the bill (*il conto*) and others reimbursing later. Trying to split a €24.50 bill into **five different cards** is a disaster.

## Example Dialogue  

**Scenario**: Geoff and Viktor are having dinner, and Geoff is unknowingly breaking *every* Italian dining rule.  

- **Geoff**: *Scusi, posso avere un cappuccino con la mia lasagna?* *(Excuse me, can I have a cappuccino with my lasagna?)*  
- **Waiter**: *...* *(Shocked silence.)*  
- **Viktor**: *Geoff, no! Cappuccino is only for breakfast!*  
- **Geoff**: *Oh, okay… allora, posso avere il ketchup per la pasta?* *(Oh, okay… then can I have ketchup for my pasta?)*  
- **Viktor**: *Geoff. This is serious. Italians are staring at us.*  
- **Waiter**: *Signore, in Italia la pasta si mangia senza ketchup.* *(Sir, in Italy, pasta is eaten without ketchup.)*  
- **Geoff**: *Va bene… posso almeno mettere il Parmigiano sugli spaghetti alle vongole?* *(Fine… can I at least put Parmesan on my clam pasta?)*  
- **Viktor**: *No! Basta! Mangia e basta!* *(No! Enough! Just eat!)*

## Do’s and Don’ts Recap

❌ **DON’T** put cheese on seafood pasta.  
❌ **DON’T** cut your spaghetti with a knife.  
❌ **DON’T** expect a quick meal—slow dining is part of Italian culture.
