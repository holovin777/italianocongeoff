# Lesson 10.1: Ordering Like a Local – From Antipasto to Dolce 🍝🍷  

Walking into an Italian restaurant is **an experience**, not just a meal. The aromas of fresh pasta, the sound of plates clinking, and the occasional animated discussion about soccer—it’s all part of the magic. But before you dive into the food, you’ll need to **order like a true Italian** (or at least not embarrass yourself in front of the waiter).

✅ Understand the Italian menu structure.

## Italian Menu Breakdown  

Italian meals are **structured affairs**. Unlike in some countries where you can just order a single dish and be done, **Italian meals are multi-course events**. Here’s how it works:  

| Course | Description | Example Dishes |  
|--------|------------|----------------|  
| **Antipasto** | Starter | Bruschetta, Prosciutto e Melone, Caprese Salad |  
| **Primo** | First course (usually pasta, risotto, or soup) | Spaghetti Carbonara, Risotto ai Funghi, Minestrone |  
| **Secondo** | Main course (meat or fish) | Bistecca alla Fiorentina, Pollo alla Cacciatora |  
| **Contorno** | Side dish (vegetables, salad) | Insalata Mista, Patate al Forno |  
| **Dolce** | Dessert | Tiramisu, Panna Cotta, Cannoli |  
| **Caffè** | Coffee (usually espresso) | Un caffè, Un macchiato |  

*Important:* Italians **rarely** drink cappuccino after breakfast. If you order one after dinner, the waiter might assume you're an alien.

## Cultural Tips – Do’s and Don’ts  

✅ **Do** take your time—meals in Italy are meant to be enjoyed, not rushed.  
✅ **Do** ask for recommendations. Waiters take food seriously and love to help.  
✅ **Do** expect to ask for the bill (*il conto*). It won’t magically appear.  

❌ **Don’t** ask for butter for your bread—it’s not a thing in Italy.  
❌ **Don’t** expect massive portions. Italian meals are meant to be balanced.  
❌ **Don’t** tip excessively. Service is usually included in the bill.
