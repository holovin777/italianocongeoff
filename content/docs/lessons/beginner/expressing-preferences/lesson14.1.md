# **Lesson 14.1: Likes and Dislikes – The Basics of *Piacere*** ❤️🤨  

In English, we say “I like pizza.” Easy.  

But in Italian, things flip around like a gymnast doing cartwheels. You don’t say “I like pizza” — you say **“Pizza is pleasing to me.”**  
Yes, pizza is the subject. Because, of course, **pizza is always in charge.**

## **Meet the Verb: *Piacere***  

Here’s how it works:

- **Mi piace** = *I like* (literally: it is pleasing to me)  
- **Ti piace** = *You like*  
- **Gli piace** = *He likes*  
- **Le piace** = *She likes*  
- **Ci piace** = *We like*  
- **Vi piace** = *You all like*  
- **Gli piace** = *They like*  

Use **piace** for singular nouns and verbs:  
- **Mi piace il gelato.** *(I like ice cream.)*  
- **Ti piace nuotare.** *(You like swimming.)*  

Use **piacciono** for plural nouns:  
- **Mi piacciono i biscotti.** *(I like cookies.)*  
- **Gli piacciono le lasagne.** *(He likes lasagna.)*

## **Quick Conversation**  

> **Geoff:** Mi piace la pizza.  
> **Viktor:** A chi non piace? È sacra! *(Who doesn’t like it? It’s sacred!)*  

> **Geoff:** Ti piacciono i broccoli?  
> **Viktor:** Piacciono alla mia dieta, non a me. *(My diet likes them, I don’t.)*

## **How to Say You *Don’t* Like Something**  

Simple: Just put **non** in front.

- **Non mi piace il caffè.** *(I don’t like coffee.)*  
- **Non ci piacciono i film horror.** *(We don’t like horror movies.)*  
- **A Viktor non piace lavorare di sabato.** *(Viktor doesn’t like working on Saturdays.)*

> **Warning:** Saying you don’t like coffee in Italy might cause *dramatic gasps*. Proceed with caution.
