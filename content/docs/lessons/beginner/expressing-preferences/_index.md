# **14. Expressing Preferences – Talking About Likes, Dislikes, and Preferences** ❤️😐🙅‍♂️  

Italians are passionate people. They don't just like something – they **adore it**, **live for it**, or **absolutely cannot stand it**. And if Geoff wants to blend in with the locals (or just avoid another mushroom pizza), it's time he learned to express his preferences properly.  

---

## **What You’ll Learn**  

- How to say what you like and dislike using **piacere** and other handy verbs.  
- Phrases to politely say “no thanks” without offending Nonna.  
- How to ask others about their likes (yes, you can finally ask Viktor if he actually *likes* working in IT).  
- Key expressions to talk about hobbies, food, music, and more.

## **Why It Matters**  

Imagine this scene:  

> **Viktor:** Vuoi un po’ di trippa? *(Do you want some tripe?)*  
>  
> **Geoff:** Uh… sì?  
>  
> *Two bites later, Geoff is reconsidering his life choices.*  

Knowing how to **say no with style** is as important as knowing how to say yes. Italians admire strong opinions—as long as you express them with charm.

## **Viktor’s Tip**  

> **“In Italia, anche i gusti sono un’opinione. Se dici che non ti piace il caffè, preparati a una lunga discussione filosofica.”**  

(*In Italy, even tastes are a matter of opinion. Say you don’t like coffee, and prepare for a philosophical debate.*)
