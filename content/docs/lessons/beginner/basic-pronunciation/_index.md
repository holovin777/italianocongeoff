## What You’ll Learn  

In this series, we’ll guide you through:  
- The art of pronouncing Italian vowels (*A, E, I, O, U*) like a pro.  
- Tackling consonants (*C, G, S*—we’re looking at you).  
- Double consonants and how they change everything.  
- Rolling your R’s without sounding like a helicopter.

## Why Pronunciation Matters  

Picture this:  
- **Geoff**: *Vorrei una pizza con funghi.* *(I’d like a pizza with mushrooms.)*  
- **Waiter**: *Funghi?* *(Mushrooms?)*  
- **Geoff**: *No, no! Con fumi!* *(No, no! With smoke!)*  
(Viktor quickly intervenes, saving Geoff from an ash-flavored pizza.)  

Pronunciation is more than just sounds—it’s communication. Italians love when you try to speak their language, and nailing the pronunciation makes your effort even more charming (and less confusing).

## Viktor’s Advice  

Viktor says:  
> **“Pronouncing Italian is like singing a song—each vowel and consonant has its place, and double consonants are the dramatic pauses. Start slow, and soon you’ll be an opera of perfect pronunciation!”**
