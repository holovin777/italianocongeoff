### Key Tips  

1. **Each Vowel Has One Sound**  
   Unlike English, where vowels can sound like they‚Äôre having an identity crisis, Italian vowels are consistent.  

2. **Open vs. Closed Vowels**  
   - *E*: Can be pronounced as /e/ (closed, like in *perch√©*) or /…õ/ (open, like in *bene*).  
   - *O*: Can be pronounced as /o/ (closed, like in *molto*) or /…î/ (open, like in *cos√¨*).  

3. **Practice with Words**  
   Repeat words like *amore* (love), *cane* (dog), and *vino* (wine) to get comfortable with the sounds.
