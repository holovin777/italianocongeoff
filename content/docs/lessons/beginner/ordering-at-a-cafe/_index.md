## Why It’s Important  

Picture this:  
- **Geoff**: *Buongiorno! Un cappuccino, per favore.* *(Good morning! A cappuccino, please.)*  
- **Barista**: *Certamente! Da portare via o al banco?* *(Of course! To go or at the counter?)*  
- **Geoff**: *Eh... al banco?* *(Uh... at the counter?)*  
(Viktor nods approvingly, knowing his coaching has paid off.)  

Knowing how to order in Italian will not only get you your caffeine fix but also help you blend in with locals. Plus, it’s a chance to experience Italian culture one sip at a time.
