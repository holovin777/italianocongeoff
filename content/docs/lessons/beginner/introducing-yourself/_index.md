## Why It’s Important  

Imagine this scenario:  
- **Geoff**: *Ciao! Mi chiamo Geoff. Sono di Australia. E tu?* *(Hi! My name is Geoff. I’m from Australia. And you?)*  
- **Viktor**: *Ciao, Geoff! Mi chiamo Viktor. Vivo in Italia da 10 anni.* *(Hi, Geoff! My name is Viktor. I’ve lived in Italy for 10 years.)*  
- **Geoff**: *Piacere, Viktor!* *(Nice to meet you, Viktor!)*

## Viktor’s Tips  

Viktor says:  
> **“Start with a smile and keep it simple. If all else fails, say *Piacere!* (Nice to meet you!) and let the conversation flow.”**  

Pro Tip: Italians love it when you ask about them! Practice saying *E tu?* (And you?) with enthusiasm.
