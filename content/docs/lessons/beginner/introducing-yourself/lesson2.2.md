## Mastering **Piacere**: The Magic Word  

The Italian verb **piacere** is your best friend for expressing what you like. But be warned‚Äîit‚Äôs a little tricky because it works backwards! Instead of saying ‚ÄúI like pizza,‚Äù you‚Äôre literally saying, ‚ÄúPizza is pleasing to me.‚Äù (Italians take their pizza very seriously.)  

Here‚Äôs how to use **piacere**:  

| **Italian**             | **English**                          | **Example**                               |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Mi piace [activity]**  | I like [activity]                   | Mi piace leggere. (I like reading.)       |
| **Mi piacciono [things]**| I like [things] (plural)            | Mi piacciono i film. (I like movies.)     |
