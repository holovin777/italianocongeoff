# Lesson 2.1: Introducing Yourself – Making a Great First Impression

Benvenuto! Now that you know how to greet people in Italian, let’s take the next step: introducing yourself! Italians are known for their warmth and friendliness, and knowing how to introduce yourself is essential for making connections. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to say your name, ask for someone else’s, and share a bit about where you’re from. Ready? Andiamo! (Let’s go!)

---

### 1. Saying Your Name

The simplest way to introduce yourself is to say:

- **"Mi chiamo [Your Name]."** – This means, “My name is [Your Name].”
  
For example:
- **"Mi chiamo Marco."** – My name is Marco.
- **"Mi chiamo Laura."** – My name is Laura.

> **Note**: "Mi chiamo" literally means “I call myself” – so in Italian, you’re telling people what you go by rather than stating your name directly.

### 2. Asking Someone’s Name

To keep the conversation going, you’ll want to ask the other person’s name. Here’s how:

- **"Come ti chiami?"** – This means, “What’s your name?” (informal).
- **"Come si chiama?"** – This means, “What’s your name?” (formal).

Use **"Come ti chiami?"** with friends, people your age, or kids, and **"Come si chiama?"** in more formal settings, like when speaking to someone older or in a professional setting.

### 3. Saying Where You’re From

Another common part of introductions is sharing where you’re from. Use the phrase:

- **"Sono di [City]."** – I’m from [City].
  
For example:
- **"Sono di Roma."** – I’m from Rome.
- **"Sono di Milano."** – I’m from Milan.

If you want to mention your country instead, you can say:
- **"Vengo dall’Italia."** – I come from Italy.
- **"Vengo dagli Stati Uniti."** – I come from the United States.

> **Fun Fact**: Italians love to ask where you’re from! It’s a great way to spark a friendly conversation.

### 4. Responding to Introductions

When someone introduces themselves, it’s polite to respond with a friendly phrase. Here are a few options:

- **"Piacere!"** – Nice to meet you!
- **"Molto piacere!"** – Very nice to meet you!
- **"Il piacere è mio!"** – The pleasure is mine!

These phrases show warmth and are a polite way to keep the conversation going.
