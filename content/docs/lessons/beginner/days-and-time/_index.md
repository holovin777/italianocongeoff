![Days of the Week & Time](/images/beginner/days-and-time/days-and-time.webp)

Ever wondered how Italians always seem to have time for coffee, gelato, and epic dinners? The secret lies in their mastery of the week and clock. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to navigate time like a true Italian (with a side of humor).

## What You’ll Learn  

In this lesson, we’ll cover:  
- The **days of the week** (and why Monday isn’t as scary in Italian).  
- **Telling time** like a pro, whether it’s cappuccino o’clock or aperitivo hour.  
- Fun, real-life scenarios featuring Viktor and Geoff as they juggle schedules and espresso shots.

## Why It’s Important  

Picture this:  
- **Geoff**: *A che ora apre il mercato?* *(What time does the market open?)*  
- **Viktor**: *Alle nove.* *(At 9 o’clock.)*  
- **Geoff**: *Perfetto! Ci vediamo domani… aspetta, che giorno è domani?* *(Perfect! See you tomorrow… wait, what day is tomorrow?)*  

Whether you’re making plans, catching a train, or simply trying not to miss gelato happy hour, knowing how to talk about days and time is essential. Plus, it’s an easy way to impress your Italian friends (and maybe even Viktor).

## Viktor’s Advice  

Viktor says:  
> **"When learning the days of the week, remember: Italians start with Monday. It's logical, like organizing your toolbox. Just don’t mix up martedì (Tuesday) with mercoledì (Wednesday)—trust me, Geoff’s done it before."**
