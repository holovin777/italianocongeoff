## Example Dialogue  

**Scenario**: Geoff and Viktor are planning their week.  

- **Geoff**: *Che giorno andiamo al mercato?* *(What day are we going to the market?)*  
- **Viktor**: *Sabato mattina alle nove. Ti va bene?* *(Saturday morning at 9. Does that work for you?)*  
- **Geoff**: *Perfetto! E quando ci vediamo per il caff√®?* *(Perfect! And when are we meeting for coffee?)*  
- **Viktor**: *Domani alle quattro di pomeriggio. Ti ricordi, vero?* *(Tomorrow at 4 PM. You remember, right?)*  
- **Geoff**: *Certo! Come potrei dimenticarlo?* *(Of course! How could I forget?)*

## Scheduling Tips  

1. **Keep It Simple**: Italians often specify the day and time in one sentence to avoid confusion.  
   - Example: *Ci vediamo marted√¨ alle tre.* *(See you Tuesday at 3.)*  

2. **Watch the Context**: Pay attention to whether it‚Äôs AM or PM. Italians often say *di mattina* (in the morning), *di pomeriggio* (in the afternoon), or *di sera* (in the evening) for clarity.  

3. **Practice Regularly**: Use these phrases daily to build confidence.

## Practice Time

     - *Venerd√¨ alle otto di sera: Cena con amici.* *(Friday at 8 PM: Dinner with friends.)*  

2. Plan an imaginary coffee date with a friend using Italian.
