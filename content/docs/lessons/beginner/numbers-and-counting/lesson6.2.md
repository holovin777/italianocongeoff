## The Italian Numbers: 21 to 100  

Hereâ€™s a handy chart to help you master the numbers:

| Tens    | Italian         | Examples with Units       |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 20      | **venti**       | 21 = **ventuno**, 25 = **venticinque** |
| 30      | **trenta**      | 32 = **trentadue**, 39 = **trentanove** |
| 40      | **quaranta**    | 41 = **quarantuno**, 48 = **quarantotto** |
| 50      | **cinquanta**   | 52 = **cinquantadue**, 57 = **cinquantasette** |
| 60      | **sessanta**    | 63 = **sessantatre**, 69 = **sessantanove** |
| 70      | **settanta**    | 74 = **settantquattro**, 79 = **settantanove** |
| 80      | **ottanta**     | 81 = **ottantuno**, 88 = **ottantotto** |
| 90      | **novanta**     | 92 = **novantadue**, 99 = **novantanove** |
| 100     | **cento**       | Youâ€™ve made it! ðŸŽ‰       |

### How to Construct Numbers  

Italian numbers follow a simple pattern after 20:  

1. **Tens + Units**: Just combine the tens with the units.  
   - Example: 23 = **ventitre** (*venti* + *tre*).  
2. **Drop the Final Vowel Before Uno or Otto**: When adding *uno* (1) or *otto* (8), drop the final vowel of the tens.  
   - Example: 21 = **ventuno**, 28 = **ventotto**.  
3. **Watch for Duplicates**: Numbers like 88 (*ottantotto*) are tricky but fun to say!

## Dialogue with Viktor and Geoff  

**Scenario**: Viktor and Geoff are calculating how many items Geoff needs for his dinner party.  

- **Geoff**: Viktor, devo comprare venticinque panini. *(Viktor, I need to buy 25 sandwiches.)*  
- **Viktor**: Venticinque? Per quante persone? *(25? For how many people?)*  
- **Geoff**: Trentadue persone, ma voglio panini extra. *(32 people, but I want extra sandwiches.)*  
- **Viktor**: E quanti bicchieri? *(And how many glasses?)*  
- **Geoff**: Novanta! *(Ninety!)*  
- **Viktor**: Novanta bicchieri? Sei sicuro? *(90 glasses? Are you sure?)*  
- **Geoff**: Beh, potrebbe servire un brindisi in grande stile! *(Well, we might need a grand toast!)*

## Tips from Viktor  

1. **Practice in Real Life**: Count items you buy at the store or steps you take to Viktorâ€™s house.  
2. **Focus on Problem Numbers**: Numbers like *ventotto* (28) or *ottantotto* (88) can be trickyâ€”repeat them until they feel natural.  
3. **Donâ€™t Panic**: Italians appreciate effort, so even if you mess up *quarantasette* (47), just laugh it off and try again. Viktor does it all the time!

## Fun Fact  

Italians use numbers all the time in casual conversations, from discussing the weather (*fa trenta gradi oggi!*, Itâ€™s 30 degrees today!) to estimating the queue length at the post office (*Ci sono venti persone davanti!*, There are 20 people ahead!). Geoff thinks this is why Italians are so good at math. Viktor isnâ€™t convinced.

## Practice Time  

Try saying these numbers out loud:  

1. 22 â€“ **ventidue**  
2. 37 â€“ **trentasette**  
3. 49 â€“ **quarantanove**  
4. 68 â€“ **sessantotto**  
5. 99 â€“ **novantanove**
