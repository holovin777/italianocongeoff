## How It Works  

1. **Combining Numbers**: Italian numbers 21‚Äì99 are formed by combining the tens with the units.  
   - *21 = venti + uno ‚Üí ventuno*  
   - *28 = venti + otto ‚Üí ventotto* (Note: The ‚Äúi‚Äù in *venti* disappears before vowels.)  

2. **Key Patterns**: Once you know the tens, you simply add the units!

## Key Phrases  

Here are some practical ways to use numbers beyond 20:  

1. **Quanto costa questo?** *(How much does this cost?)*  
   - Response: *Costa trentacinque euro.* *(It costs 35 euros.)*  

2. **Quanti ne vuoi?** *(How many do you want?)*  
   - Response: *Ne voglio cinquanta.* *(I want 50.)*  

3. **Quanti anni ha tua zia?** *(How old is your aunt?)*  
   - Response: *Ha sessantacinque anni.* *(She‚Äôs 65 years old.)*

## Example Dialogue  

**Scenario**: Geoff is at a market buying fruits. Viktor is (unsurprisingly) the vendor.  

- **Geoff**: *Buongiorno, quanto costano queste mele?* *(Good morning, how much do these apples cost?)*  
- **Viktor**: *Costano due euro al chilo. Quanti ne vuole?* *(They cost two euros per kilo. How many do you want?)*  
- **Geoff**: *Ne prendo cinque chili. Quanto pago?* *(I‚Äôll take 5 kilos. How much do I pay?)*  
- **Viktor**: *Dieci euro in totale. Grazie mille!* *(Ten euros total. Thank you very much!)*  

---

## Practice Time  

Use the numbers you‚Äôve learned in these scenarios:  

1. You‚Äôre buying 32 oranges. Tell the vendor how many you want.  
   - *Ne voglio trentadue.*  

2. Ask the price of 50 euros for a pair of shoes.  
   - *Quanto costano queste scarpe?*  

3. Respond when someone asks how old your cousin is (he‚Äôs 28).  
   - *Ha ventotto anni.*  

---

## Quick Tips  

1. **Practice Counting Aloud**: Say the numbers repeatedly to get comfortable.  
2. **Remember the Patterns**: Tens + Units is your formula.  
3. **Have Fun**: Use numbers in everyday situations like ordering food or setting timers.
