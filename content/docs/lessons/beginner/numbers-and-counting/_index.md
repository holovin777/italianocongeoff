# 6. Numbers and Counting – From Zero to Hero (and Maybe 100!) 🔢🇮🇹  

![Numbers and Counting](/images/beginner-level/numbers-and-counting/numbers-and-counting.webp)

Numbers are everywhere—markets, restaurants, and even on the train when Geoff realizes he’s sitting in carriage 12 instead of 2. Mastering Italian numbers is more than just math; it’s the key to navigating daily life with confidence (and avoiding accidental over-purchases).

## What You’ll Learn  

In this section, you’ll dive into:  
- The basics: Numbers from 0 to 100.  
- Practical applications: Dates, times, and prices.  
- Fun counting games to keep things lively (Viktor’s idea, of course).

## Why It’s Important  

Picture this:  
- **Geoff**: *Quanto costano questi pomodori?* *(How much do these tomatoes cost?)*  
- **Viktor (the vendor)**: *Due euro al chilo.* *(Two euros per kilo.)*  
- **Geoff**: *Perfetto, prendo dodici chili.* *(Perfect, I’ll take 12 kilos.)*  
(Viktor stares as Geoff attempts to carry a mountain of tomatoes home.)  

Numbers in Italian will save you from comedic misadventures and help you impress the locals with your precision.
