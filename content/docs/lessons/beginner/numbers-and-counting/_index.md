# 6. Numbers and Counting – From Zero to Hero (and Maybe 100!) 🔢🇮🇹  

Welcome to the magical world of Italian numbers! Whether you’re bargaining at the market, telling Viktor how many espressos you’ve had today, or confidently giving directions in kilometers instead of miles (sorry, Geoff), mastering numbers in Italian is essential.

## What You’ll Learn  

In this lesson, we’ll cover:  
- The basics: Numbers from 0 to 100 (don’t worry, we’ll count slowly).  
- Tips for dates, times, and prices—because ordering *quattro* pizzas is different from ordering *quattordici*.  
- Fun ways to practice, including games and real-world scenarios with Viktor.

## Why It’s Important  

Imagine this:  
- **Geoff**: *Quanto costa questo?* *(How much does this cost?)*  
- **Vendor**: *Venti euro.* *(Twenty euros.)*  
- **Geoff**: *Ah, grazie!* *(Ah, thanks!)*  
(Geoff hands over 50 euros and doesn’t realize he’s owed change. Viktor facepalms in the background.)  

Numbers are everywhere, and learning them can save you money, time, and maybe even embarrassment. Plus, once you master them, you can impress Italians by counting faster than they can pour wine.

## Viktor’s Advice  

Viktor says:  
> **“Counting in Italian is like learning to dance—it’s all about rhythm. Start with uno, due, tre, and before you know it, you’re tangoing your way to cento!”**  

And remember, if you mess up, just laugh it off. Italians love a good chuckle, and so does Viktor.
