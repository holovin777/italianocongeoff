| 14     | quattordici | *KWA-tor-dee-chee*    | The long cousin of *quattro*. |
| 15     | quindici    | *KWEEN-dee-chee*      | Sounds like "queen"â€”regal and memorable. |
| 16     | sedici      | *SEH-dee-chee*        | Almost there! "Six plus ten." |
| 17     | diciassette | *DEE-chah-SET-teh*    | Italians consider 17 unluckyâ€”be careful! |

## Dialogue with Viktor and Geoff  

**Scenario**: Geoff visits Viktor for help counting in Italian.  

- **Geoff**: Viktor, posso contare fino a venti in italiano! *(Viktor, I can count to twenty in Italian!)*  
- **Viktor**: Davvero? Fammi sentire. *(Really? Let me hear it.)*  
- **Geoff**: Uno, due, tre... quattordici...  
- **Viktor**: Aspetta! Ãˆ *quattro*, non *quattordici*! *(Wait! Itâ€™s *four*, not *fourteen*!)  
- **Geoff**: Ah, scusa! Quattro. *(Ah, sorry! Four.)*  
- **Viktor**: Bene, ma non fare quellâ€™errore al mercato. Potresti comprare quattordici chili di mele! *(Good, but donâ€™t make that mistake at the market. You might buy fourteen kilos of apples!)*

## Tips from Viktor  

1. **Practice Out Loud**: Numbers are easier to remember when you say them aloud. Viktor says counting gelato scoops is the best practice.  
2. **Focus on Similar Numbers**: Watch out for pairs like *quattro* and *quattordici* or *due* and *dodici*. They sound close but mean very different things!  
3. **Use Everyday Situations**: Count steps, count espressos, or count the number of times Viktor shakes his head at Geoffâ€™s mistakes.
