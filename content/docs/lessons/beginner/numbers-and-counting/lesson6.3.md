Numbers are great, but what good are they if you canâ€™t use them to tell time or set a date? In this lesson, weâ€™ll teach you how to confidently manage dates and times in Italianâ€”so you can finally stop showing up at the wrong cafÃ© at *dodici* (12) when Viktor clearly said *diciassette* (17).

## The Basics of Time  

Hereâ€™s how to tell time like a pro:  

| Italian Phrase                  | English Translation         | Usage                                      |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Che ore sono?**               | What time is it?            | Use this to ask anyone, except Viktorâ€”he prefers watches over phones. |
| **Ãˆ lâ€™una.**                    | Itâ€™s one oâ€™clock.           | For 1:00 only. Italians love this little quirk. |
| **Sono le due.**                | Itâ€™s two oâ€™clock.           | For 2:00 and beyond. Easy peasy!          |
| **Mezzogiorno**                 | Noon                        | Fancy way of saying 12:00 PM.             |
| **Mezzanotte**                  | Midnight                    | When Geoff is asleep, but Viktor is debugging code. |
| **E un quarto**                 | And a quarter (15 minutes)  | Example: 3:15 = *Sono le tre e un quarto.* |
| **E mezza**                     | And a half (30 minutes)     | Example: 4:30 = *Sono le quattro e mezza.* |
| **Meno un quarto**              | Quarter to (45 minutes)     | Example: 5:45 = *Sono le sei meno un quarto.* |

## Talking About Dates  

Dates in Italian are like espresso shotsâ€”simple but powerful. Hereâ€™s how they work:  

| Italian Phrase                  | English Translation         | Example                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Che giorno Ã¨ oggi?**          | What day is today?          | *Oggi Ã¨ il cinque maggio.* (Today is the 5th of May.) |
| **Il mio compleanno Ã¨ il...**   | My birthday is on...         | *Il mio compleanno Ã¨ il dieci agosto.* (My birthday is on August 10th.) |
| **Andiamo il sette aprile.**    | Weâ€™re going on April 7th.    | Perfect for planning adventures with Viktor. |

## Dialogue with Viktor and Geoff  

**Scenario**: Viktor is trying to teach Geoff how to plan a meetup without confusion.  

- **Viktor**: Che ore sono, Geoff? *(What time is it, Geoff?)*  
- **Geoff**: Sono le quattro e mezza! *(Itâ€™s 4:30!)*  
- **Viktor**: Bene, incontriamoci alle cinque meno un quarto. *(Great, letâ€™s meet at 4:45.)*  
- **Geoff**: Ma aspetta... Ã¨ prima o dopo le cinque? *(Wait... is that before or after five?)*  
- **Viktor**: Prima. Se arrivi dopo, dovrai pagare il caffÃ¨! *(Before. If youâ€™re late, youâ€™re paying for the coffee!)*  

*(Geoff now sets 15 alarms on his phone to avoid being late.)*

## Viktorâ€™s Tips for Time and Dates  

1. **Be Clear, Not Casual**: Italians love precision with times. Saying *cinque meno un quarto* sounds cooler than *4:45*, so learn it well.  
2. **Use the Article "Il" for Dates**: Always say *il* before the date. For example, *il quindici settembre* (September 15). Viktor says skipping this is like showing up to a dinner without wineâ€”just donâ€™t.  
3. **Practice Daily**: Use dates and times in your daily routine. Viktor recommends planning mealsâ€”itâ€™s practical and delicious.

## Fun Fact  

In Italy, the week starts on Monday (*lunedÃ¬*), not Sunday. This confuses Geoff endlessly, but Viktor insists itâ€™s logicalâ€”after all, *domenica* (Sunday) is a day of rest, not a starting point.

---

## Practice Time  

1. **What time is it?**  
   - Imagine itâ€™s 3:15. Respond: **Sono le tre e un quarto.**  
2. **Set the date!**  
   - Your friendâ€™s birthday is August 24. Say: **Il compleanno del mio amico Ã¨ il ventiquattro agosto.**  
3. **Plan a meetup:**  
   - You want to meet Viktor at 6:30 PM. Say: **Incontriamoci alle sei e mezza.**
