- **Vorrei un po‚Äô di [item].** *(I‚Äôd like some [item].)*  
- **Posso assaggiare?** *(Can I taste?)*  

### Haggling (Politely)

## Cultural Tips  

1. **Start with a Smile**: Always greet the vendor with *Buongiorno!* or *Buonasera!* before diving into your shopping list.  
2. **Know Your Quantities**: Italians often sell fresh produce by weight, so learn words like *un chilo* (1 kilogram) and *mezzo chilo* (half a kilogram).  
3. **Be Open to Suggestions**: Vendors love sharing their expertise. If they suggest *questa mozzarella √® la migliore* (this mozzarella is the best), they probably mean it.

### Example Dialogue  

**Scenario**: Geoff is at a market in Padova, and Viktor is running the cheese stall (again).  

- **Geoff**: *Buongiorno! Quanto costa questa mozzarella?* *(Good morning! How much does this mozzarella cost?)*  
- **Viktor**: *Cinque euro al chilo.* *(Five euros per kilo.)*  
- **Geoff**: *Perfetto, ne prendo mezzo chilo.* *(Perfect, I‚Äôll take half a kilo.)*  
- **Viktor**: *Subito! Altro?* *(Right away! Anything else?)*  
- **Geoff**: *No, grazie! Quanto pago?* *(No, thank you! How much do I pay?)*  
- **Viktor**: *Due euro e cinquanta. Grazie mille!* *(Two euros and fifty cents. Thank you very much!)*

## Practice Time  

Try using these phrases in the following scenarios:  

1. You want to ask for the price of apples and buy 2 kilos.  
   - *Quanto costano queste mele?*  
   - *Ne prendo due chili.*  

2. You‚Äôre curious about the taste of a fruit. Ask if you can try it.  
   - *Posso assaggiare?*  

3. You want to buy some basil but don‚Äôt know how much.  
   - *Vorrei un po‚Äô di basilico.*

## Quick Tips  

- **Bring Cash**: Markets in Italy are often cash-based.  
- **Trust the Vendor**: They know their products well and will guide you to the freshest picks.  
- **Politeness Pays Off**: A kind word or two might get you a better deal‚Äîor at least a smile!
