1. **Quanto costa?** *(How much does it cost?)*  
   - The bread-and-butter phrase for every market transaction.  

2. **Ne prendo due chili.** *(I’ll take two kilos.)*  
   - Master this phrase to avoid accidentally ending up with two tomatoes instead of two kilos of tomatoes.  

3. **Avete qualcosa di più fresco?** *(Do you have something fresher?)*  
   - A polite way to ask for the best produce without offending the vendor.  

4. **È biologico?** *(Is it organic?)*  
   - Bonus points for sounding eco-conscious, even if you just really like the word *biologico*.

## The Golden Rules of Market Etiquette  

1. **Do Greet First**: Always start with *Buongiorno* (Good morning) or *Buonasera* (Good evening). Skipping this is like starting a meal without *antipasto*—it just feels wrong.  

2. **Don’t Touch the Produce**: In many Italian markets, vendors take pride in selecting the best items for you. Touching the fruit might be seen as an act of treason against their expertise.  

3. **Be Ready for Change Drama**: Small vendors often don’t love breaking big bills. Keep smaller denominations handy to avoid the “raised eyebrow of doom.”  

4. **Compliments Are Currency**: A sincere *Che bello!* (How beautiful!) about their produce can sometimes earn you a smile—or at least a slightly better price.

## Fun Fact  

Italian markets are more than just places to shop—they’re social hubs. Vendors love to chat, and even if your Italian isn’t perfect, a little effort goes a long way. Don’t be surprised if they throw in a free orange or a handful of herbs after a friendly conversation.
