## Key Phrases You‚Äôll Master  

### 1. Asking the Price  
- **Quanto costa?** *(How much does it cost?)*  
  - The essential phrase you‚Äôll use everywhere, from the market to high-end stores.  
- **Quanto costano?** *(How much do they cost?)*  
  - Plural version for when you‚Äôre eyeing multiple items‚Äîlike shoes. Lots of shoes.

### 2. Polite Requests  
- **Posso provarlo/la?** *(Can I try it on?)*  
  - For clothing. Use **lo** for masculine items (e.g., *il cappotto*, the coat) and **la** for feminine items (e.g., *la giacca*, the jacket).  
- **Posso vedere quello?** *(Can I see that?)*  
  - Perfect for pointing at something just out of reach, like the prettiest scarf in the shop.  

---

### 3. Handling Money  
- **Posso pagare con carta di credito?** *(Can I pay with a credit card?)*  
  - Always good to ask, especially in small shops where cash is often king.  
- **Ha il resto?** *(Do you have change?)*  
  - Because handing over a ‚Ç¨50 bill for a ‚Ç¨4 purchase might earn you a raised eyebrow.

### 4. Numbers in Action  
Brush up on your Italian numbers to avoid confusion:  
- 15: *quindici*  
- 50: *cinquanta*  
- 100: *cento*  
  - Mishearing these might turn a ‚Ç¨15 scarf into a ‚Ç¨50 investment‚Äîor worse, a ‚Ç¨100 surprise!

## Common Shopping Scenarios

## Cultural Tips  

1. **Always Greet First**: Say *Buongiorno* or *Buonasera* before asking questions‚Äîit‚Äôs polite and expected.  
2. **Don‚Äôt Touch Without Permission**: In markets, let the vendor handle the produce.  
3. **Compliments Work Wonders**: Saying *Che bello!* (How beautiful!) about an item might get you a warmer response‚Äîor even a small discount.  
4. **Be Ready to Walk Away**: In markets, a little hesitation might prompt the vendor to lower the price. But if they don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt take it personally‚Äîthey might just really like their tomatoes.
