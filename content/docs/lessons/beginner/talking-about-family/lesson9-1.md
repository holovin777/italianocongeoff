## Example Dialogue  

**Scenario**: Geoff is meeting Viktor’s family for the first time.  

- **Geoff**: *Ciao Viktor! Questa è la tua famiglia?*  
  *(Hi Viktor! Is this your family?)*  
- **Viktor**: *Sì! Ti presento mia madre, mio padre e mia sorella.*  
  *(Yes! Let me introduce you to my mother, my father, and my sister.)*  
- **Geoff**: *Piacere di conoscervi!*  
  *(Nice to meet you!)*  
- **Viktor**: *E questo è mio zio Carlo.*  
  *(And this is my uncle Carlo.)*  
- **Geoff**: *Ciao, Zio Carlo! Amo l’Italia!*  
  *(Hi, Uncle Carlo! I love Italy!)*  
- **Zio Carlo**: *Bravo! Ma attenzione—io non sono il cane!*  
  *(Good job! But careful—I’m not the dog!)*  

---

## Practice Time  

1. **Introduce Your Family**:  
   Try introducing your own family members in Italian. For example:  
   - *Questa è mia madre.* *(This is my mother.)*  
   - *Questo è mio fratello.* *(This is my brother.)*  

2. **Fill in the Blanks**:  
   Complete the sentences with the correct family member.  
   - *Mio ___ è molto simpatico.* *(My mother is very nice.)*  
   - *La mia ___ cucina la migliore pasta!* *(My grandmother cooks the best pasta!)*  

---

## Quick Tips  

- **Formal vs. Informal**: When meeting someone’s family for the first time, it’s polite to use formal greetings like *Piacere di conoscerla* (Nice to meet you).  
- **Plural Forms**: Remember that *genitori* means *parents*, and *fratelli* can mean *siblings* (not just brothers).  
- **Beware of False Friends**: *Parenti* means *relatives*, not *parents*! Don’t mix them up or you’ll confuse everyone.
