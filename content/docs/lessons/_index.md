## What Youâ€™ll Learn  

Our lessons are grouped into three levels to guide you on your journey:  

### Beginner Lessons  
Perfect for starting your Italian adventure. Learn the essentials like greetings, numbers, and how to order your first espresso without accidentally asking for a *horse* instead of *coffee*.  

### Intermediate Lessons  
Take your skills to the next level. Discuss hobbies, navigate Italian transportation, and finally learn the grammar youâ€™ve been avoiding (we promise, itâ€™s painless!).  

### Advanced Lessons  
Master the art of debating, learn idiomatic expressions, and tackle formal writing. These lessons will help you sound like a true Italianâ€”pizza jokes included.
