# Lesson 1: Basic Greetings

![Lesson1](/images/lessons/lesson1/b2587f28-0d43-4ff6-985a-1f66758db6fc.webp)

Benvenuto! In this first lesson, we’ll dive into some basic Italian greetings. Knowing how to greet people is the first step to sounding friendly (and maybe even a little Italian). So, let’s get started!

## 1. Saying “Hello” – The Classic **Ciao!**

The most versatile Italian greeting is **Ciao!**. You can say this when you meet someone and when you’re leaving – it’s the Italian way of saying both “Hello” and “Goodbye.”

- **Example**: 
  - *You*: Ciao!
  - *Italian Friend*: Ciao!

> **Note**: “Ciao” is informal. Use it with friends, family, and people you’re comfortable with. If you say it to your boss, though, expect a raised eyebrow.

## 2. “Good Morning” and “Good Afternoon”

If you want to sound a bit more formal, use these greetings:

- **Buongiorno** – Good morning (used until about 2 PM)
- **Buon pomeriggio** – Good afternoon (used in the afternoon but not very common; “Buongiorno” can cover this too)

- **Example**:
  - *You*: Buongiorno!
  - *Barista*: Buongiorno! Un caffè?

## 3. “Good Evening” and “Good Night”

For later in the day, Italians use different greetings:

- **Buonasera** – Good evening (from around 5 PM onwards)
- **Buonanotte** – Good night (when you’re saying goodbye for the night)

- **Example**:
  - *You*: Buonasera!
  - *Waiter*: Buonasera! Tavolo per due?

## 4. When in Doubt, Go with “Salve”

If you’re unsure whether to use “Ciao” or “Buongiorno,” you can say **Salve**. It’s neutral, polite, and works in almost any situation.

- **Example**:
  - *You*: Salve!
  - *Neighbor*: Salve!

> **Fun Fact**: Italians don’t really say “Salve” much, but it’s a safe option if you’re stuck.

## Quick Recap

- **Ciao** – Hello/Goodbye (informal)
- **Buongiorno** – Good morning
- **Buonasera** – Good evening
- **Buonanotte** – Good night
- **Salve** – Hello (neutral)

## Practice Time

Try practicing these phrases out loud! Next time you meet someone, see if you can start with a friendly “Ciao!” or “Buongiorno!” – and remember, a little enthusiasm goes a long way.
