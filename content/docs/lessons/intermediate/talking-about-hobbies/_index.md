How do you say “I love painting,” “I play the guitar,” or “I do yoga every Tuesday” — in Italian?  
In this unit, you’ll learn to talk about what you **enjoy doing** in your free time (or even at work, if you're lucky like Viktor).

Whether you're into dancing, coding, gardening, or arguing with tomatoes (Geoff again...), this unit will teach you how to describe your **interests** and **activities** clearly and naturally.
