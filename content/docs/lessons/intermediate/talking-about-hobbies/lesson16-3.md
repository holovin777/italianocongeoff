# Lesson 16.3: How Often? – Talking About Frequency in Italian 📅🧘‍♂️🏃‍♂️

You’ve talked about your hobbies.  
You’ve asked others about theirs.  
Now it’s time for the truth: **how often do you actually do them?**

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to describe how frequently you do something — whether you’re a daily reader, a weekend hiker, or someone who says “I jog” but last ran in 2017 (👀 Geoff).

## Frequency Words in Italian

| Italian           | English          |
|-------------------|------------------|
| ogni giorno       | every day        |
| sempre            | always           |
| spesso            | often            |
| qualche volta     | sometimes        |
| raramente         | rarely           |
| mai               | never            |
| il lunedì         | on Mondays       |
| due volte a settimana | twice a week |

You can place them **before** or **after** the verb, depending on the phrase.

Examples:

- **Leggo ogni giorno.** → I read every day.  
- **Vado in palestra due volte a settimana.** → I go to the gym twice a week.  
- **Non cucino mai.** → I never cook.

## How to Use Them

Combine your hobby verbs from Lesson 16.1 and 16.2 with these time expressions:

- **Faccio yoga ogni mattina.**  
- **Gioco a basket il sabato.**  
- **Non suono mai il flauto.** (The flute forgives you.)

## 🎭 Geoff & Viktor Get Honest (with English translations)

**Geoff:** Viktor, tu **fai karate** ogni giorno?  
**Geoff:** Viktor, do you do karate every day?

**Viktor:** Quasi. **Mi alleno** cinque volte a settimana.  
**Viktor:** Almost. I train five times a week.

**Geoff:** Impressionante. Io **corro**... qualche volta.  
**Geoff:** Impressive. I run... sometimes.

**Viktor:** Quando, scusa?  
**Viktor:** When, exactly?

**Geoff:** Ultimamente... nel sogno.

## Expressions + Negation

To say “never,” use **non** + verb + **mai**:

- **Non gioco mai a tennis.** → I never play tennis.  
- **Non vado mai in palestra.** → I never go to the gym.  
- **Non cucino mai il venerdì.** → I never cook on Fridays.

(We don’t ask why. Maybe it's pizza night.)

## Practice Tip 💬

Try combining:

- A **verb** from your hobby list  
- A **time expression**  
- An **adverb of frequency**

Example:

> Io **leggo** spesso **la sera**.  
> Noi **facciamo sport** **due volte a settimana**.
