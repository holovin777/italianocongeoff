# 14. Expressing Preferences – Talking about Likes, Dislikes, and Preferences 💬🍕🎻

![expressing-preferences](/images/intermediate/expressing-preferences/expressing-preferences.webp/)

Benvenuto! In this unit, we dive into one of the most important parts of everyday conversation: **saying what you like (or don’t).** Because let’s be honest — you can’t live in Italy without learning how to express your deep love for pizza, your passionate dislike for traffic, or your strong preference for gelato *al pistacchio*.

Whether you’re ordering at a restaurant, chatting with locals, or just arguing with Geoff about which coffee is best, this unit will give you the tools to share your thoughts with style.

## What You'll Learn

- How to say what you like (and sound enthusiastic, not robotic)
- How to express dislike politely (or dramatically, if you’re feeling theatrical)
- How to talk about preferences using real-life Italian
- How to use verbs like **piacere**, **preferire**, and **odiare** (careful — *piacere* is trickier than it looks!)

## Topics You'll Explore

- Talking about food, music, places, and hobbies
- Agreeing and disagreeing with others’ preferences  
- Sounding natural when you say *"I don’t like that thing… at all."*
