# Lesson 14.3: Love It, Hate It – Talking About Strong Preferences ❤️🤢

Okay, you've learned how to say *“I like pizza.”*  
But what if you **really** like something? Or, on the other hand, you want to politely (or dramatically) say: *“I hate it.”*

Welcome to the world of **emotional preferences** — where Italian gets a little more theatrical. 🎭

---

## Meet the Verbs

### 💖 *Amare* – To Love

Use *amare* for stronger affection or passion — people, hobbies, food you’d marry if it were legal.

- **Amo il caffè.** → I love coffee.  
- **Amo viaggiare in Italia.** → I love traveling in Italy.  
- **Non amo molto il calcio.** → I'm not a big fan of football.

---

### 😡 *Odiare* – To Hate

Sometimes... you just can’t pretend.  
- **Odio il traffico.** → I hate traffic.  
- **Odio svegliarmi presto.** → I hate waking up early.  
- **Non odio il formaggio, ma neanche lo amo.** → I don't hate cheese, but I don't love it either.

> Be careful: Italians are expressive, but hate is still a strong word — use it like hot pepper: just enough.
