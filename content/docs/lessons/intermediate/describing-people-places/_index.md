# Describing People and Places – Adjectives in Action! 🧍‍♂️🏡

![describing-people-and-places](/images/intermediate/describing-people-and-places/describing-people-and-places.webp/)

Up until now, maybe you’ve only described things as “good,” “bad,” or “very pizza.” That ends here.

In this unit, we’ll dive into the wonderful world of **adjectives** – those magical words that turn your sentences from *meh* to *ma che bello!*

You’ll learn how to describe:

- People (like that charming neighbor who always says *“Buongiorno!”* but whose name you still don’t know)
- Places (from tiny villages in the mountains to chaotic markets full of shouting and basil)

## Why It Matters

Adjectives help you:

✅ Sound more fluent  
✅ Make your stories interesting  
✅ Avoid accidentally describing your friend as “a little embarrassing” (unless you mean to)

Whether you're talking about Geoff’s peaceful balcony or Viktor’s messy notebook, you’ll pick up real Italian used in real situations.

## Start Here 👇

👉 [Begin with the first lesson](./lesson13-1/) – and learn how to describe people without using wild hand gestures (unless you want to).
