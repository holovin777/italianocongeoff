# Lesson 13.1: Describing People – From Tall to Talkative 🧍‍♀️🧍‍♂️

So, you’ve mastered “Ciao, mi chiamo Geoff” — and now it’s time to add a little flair.

Imagine meeting someone new and only being able to say:  
> “This is… a person.”

Not great, right? Let’s fix that.

## The Magic of Adjectives ✨

Adjectives are the spice in your sentence soup. Want to say someone is kind, tall, funny, or *a bit too loud at parties*? You’ll need adjectives.

### Examples:

- **Lui è alto.** → He is tall.  
- **Lei è simpatica.** → She is nice.  
- **Viktor è molto paziente.** → Viktor is very patient. (Especially when Geoff forgets *un’altra volta* what “bello” means.)

## Agreement Matters! 🧠

In Italian, adjectives **agree** with the gender and number of the noun:

| Noun          | Adjective        | Translation            |
|---------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Il ragazzo    | è alto           | The boy is tall        |
| La ragazza    | è alta           | The girl is tall       |
| I ragazzi     | sono alti        | The boys are tall      |
| Le ragazze    | sono alte        | The girls are tall     |

Yes, even adjectives need to dress properly.

## Useful Adjectives for People

| Italian     | English        |
|-------------|----------------|
| alto/a      | tall           |
| basso/a     | short          |
| simpatico/a | nice/friendly  |
| gentile     | kind/polite    |
| divertente  | funny          |
| timido/a    | shy            |
| intelligente| intelligent    |
| chiacchierone/a | talkative  |

Try describing someone you know. (Yes, even your neighbour who waters the plants in their pajamas.)
