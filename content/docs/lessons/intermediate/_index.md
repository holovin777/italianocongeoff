# Welcome to the Intermediate Level! 🇮🇹🎯

![Intermediate](/images/intermediate/intermediate.webp/)

So... Geoff made it through the beginner level without accidentally ordering a cat instead of a coffee. Success! 🐱➡️☕

Now it’s time for the next step: learning real Italian with **Viktor**, who’s been living in Italy for 10 years and has heard every grammar mistake in the book (most of them from Geoff).

## What’s Waiting for You Here?

- New tenses (because one past tense clearly wasn’t enough)
- Useful phrases you’ll actually hear in Italy (no more "the pen of my aunt is on the table")
- Real conversations with subtitles and some laughs
- Grammar tips that won’t make your brain melt (we promise)

## Is This for You?

Definitely, if:

- You’ve finished the beginner level
- You can survive in an Italian café (bonus points if you didn’t spill anything)
- You're curious, motivated, and not afraid of a little subjunctive drama

## Start Here ➡️

👉 [Describing People & Places](./describing-people-places/)  
Your first intermediate lesson! Learn how to describe humans, cats, baristas, and small towns like a true Italian.
