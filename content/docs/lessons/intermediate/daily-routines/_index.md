# 17. Daily Routines – Talking About Your Day Like a True Italian ⏰🛁🍝

You wake up. You drink coffee. You go to work (or pretend to).  
But how do you say all that in Italian?

In this unit, Geoff and Viktor dive into the wonderful world of **daily routines** —  
whether it’s waking up at 6 AM for karate (Viktor) or snoozing the alarm 4 times before opening one eye (Geoff).

You'll learn how to:

- Use reflexive verbs to talk about **what you do to yourself** (like *mi sveglio*, *mi lavo*)  
- Describe a typical day — from breakfast to bedtime  
- Talk about habits like an expressive Italian (bonus points for hand gestures)  
- Complain about Mondays in Italian (a national tradition)

💬 **Coming up next:** [Lesson 17.1](./lesson17-1) — It all begins with waking up… unless you're Geoff. Then it begins with hitting snooze.
