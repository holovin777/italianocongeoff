![making-plans](/images/intermediate/making-plans/making-plans.png/)

So… how do you say:  
"Let’s meet tomorrow?"  
"What are you doing this weekend?"  
Or… Geoff’s favorite: "We should go jogging... someday."

In this unit, Geoff and Viktor explore the art of **making plans in Italian**.  
From arranging coffee dates to planning big (or small) adventures, you’ll learn how to:

- Talk about **future plans**  
- Use verbs like **volere** (to want), **potere** (to be able), and **dovere** (to have to)  
- Suggest meeting times  
- Politely cancel plans at the last minute (Geoff’s specialty)

## What You’ll Learn

- How to suggest doing something together  
- Talking about days, times, and places  
- Using **modal verbs** to express possibility, obligation, and desire  
- The difference between **“I want to do it”** and **“I might do it… if I feel like it”**
