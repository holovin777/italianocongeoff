# Lesson 15.1: Regular Present Tense Verbs – The Well-Behaved Ones 👩‍🏫✅

Not all heroes wear capes — some just follow grammar rules.  
Meet regular verbs in the present tense: the ones that don’t throw surprises (unlike *essere*, *avere*, and Geoff on a Monday morning).

## The Three Regular Verb Endings

In Italian, regular verbs fall into three lovely and predictable groups:

| Verb Ending | Example Verb | Translation |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **-are**    | parlare        | to speak    |
| **-ere**    | vivere         | to live     |
| **-ire**    | dormire        | to sleep    |

Let’s see how they work.

## 1. Conjugating *-are* Verbs (e.g. *parlare*)

| Subject | Verb Form     | Translation     |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| io      | parl**o**     | I speak         |
| tu      | parl**i**     | you speak       |
| lui/lei | parl**a**     | he/she speaks   |
| noi     | parl**iamo**  | we speak        |
| voi     | parl**ate**   | you all speak   |
| loro    | parl**ano**   | they speak      |

✅ *Bonus tip:* Just remove **-are** and add the endings!

## 2. Conjugating *-ere* Verbs (e.g. *vivere*)

| Subject | Verb Form      | Translation     |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| io      | viv**o**       | I live          |
| tu      | viv**i**       | you live        |
| lui/lei | viv**e**       | he/she lives    |
| noi     | viv**iamo**    | we live         |
| voi     | viv**ete**     | you all live    |
| loro    | viv**ono**     | they live       |

## 3. Conjugating *-ire* Verbs (e.g. *dormire*)

## Geoff & Viktor Learn to Speak... and Sleep 😴

**Geoff:** Io parlo italiano!  
**Geoff:** I speak Italian!

**Viktor:** Bravo! E io dormo... perché tu parli molto. 😆  
**Viktor:** Good job! And I sleep... because you talk a lot. 😆

**Geoff:** Ma noi impariamo insieme, vero?  
**Geoff:** But we’re learning together, right?

**Viktor:** Certo! Ma dopo, viviamo un po’ di silenzio?  
**Viktor:** Of course! But afterwards, shall we live a little silence?

## Try It Yourself

Take three regular verbs and conjugate them fully:
- lavorare (to work)  
- scrivere (to write)  
- partire (to leave)

And don’t worry — these ones follow the rules. Enjoy it while it lasts.
