# Lesson 15.3: Mix It Up – Regular & Irregular Verbs in Action 🌀🗣️

You’ve learned the nice verbs (the regulars).  
You’ve survived the rebels (the irregulars).  
Now it’s time to **use them together** — just like Italians do every single day while cooking, shopping, and accidentally starting arguments about tomatoes.

## Quick Recap: Regular vs. Irregular 🍝

| Verb Type  | Example     | Meaning         |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Regular    | parlare     | to speak        |
| Regular    | cucinare    | to cook         |
| Irregular  | essere      | to be           |
| Irregular  | avere       | to have         |
| Irregular  | fare        | to do/make      |
| Irregular  | andare      | to go           |

You’ll see these verbs everywhere — in shops, cafés, and Geoff’s existential food crises.

**Viktor:** Geoff... **sei** sicuro che **stai bene**?  
**Viktor:** Geoff... are you sure you’re okay?

**Geoff:** No! E adesso non **ho** più pomodori!  
**Geoff:** No! And now I don’t have any more tomatoes!

**Viktor:** Allora **vai** al mercato e **compra** altri.  
**Viktor:** Then go to the market and buy more.

**Geoff:** Ma i pomodori **mi odiano**.  
**Geoff:** But the tomatoes hate me.

**Viktor:** Forse perché tu **li cucini** male?  
**Viktor:** Maybe because you cook them badly?

**Geoff:** **Faccio** del mio meglio!  
**Geoff:** I do my best!

**Viktor:** **Parli**, **parli**, ma alla fine... **io cucino**.  
**Viktor:** You talk and talk, but in the end... I cook.

**Geoff:** È un complotto. Anche la pasta **ride** di me.  
**Geoff:** It’s a conspiracy. Even the pasta laughs at me.

## Practice Tip 🧠

Want to sound natural in conversation? Mix these steps:

1. Use **irregular verbs** for identity, possession, and movement (essere, avere, andare, fare).
2. Use **regular verbs** for everything else — and trust the endings.
3. Throw in a little chaos, like Geoff, for fluency. 😉

## Try It Yourself!

Write a mini-dialogue:
- Use at least **2 regular** and **2 irregular** verbs
- Bonus points if it includes food, shopping, or a fictional pasta emergency
