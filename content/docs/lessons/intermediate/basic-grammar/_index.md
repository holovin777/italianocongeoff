# 15. Basic Grammar: Present Tense Verbs – Regular and Irregular Verbs, Finally Explained! 🧠⏰

![basic-grammar](/images/intermediate/basic-grammar/basic-grammar.webp/)

So far, you've learned how to say what you like, prefer, and completely hate.  
But how do you talk about what you **do** every day?

Welcome to the jungle of **present tense verbs** – where some verbs are well-behaved... and others? Total rebels.

In this unit, you’ll meet both the angels and troublemakers of Italian grammar:
- Regular verbs like *parlare*, *vivere*, *dormire* (They follow the rules! We love them.)
- Irregular verbs like *essere*, *avere*, *andare* (They do their own thing. We tolerate them.)

## What You’ll Learn

- How to conjugate regular *-are*, *-ere*, and *-ire* verbs  
- How to spot an irregular verb (hint: it confuses Geoff)  
- Useful verbs you’ll actually use in daily conversations  
- How to say things like: “I work, you study, Viktor sleeps, Geoff eats pasta.”

## You’ll Also Practice:

- Making full sentences with correct verb forms  
- Understanding subject pronouns (io, tu, lui/lei...)  
- Conjugation games that are actually fun (we promise)
