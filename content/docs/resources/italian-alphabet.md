### Pronunciation Tips  

- **Double consonants**: Pronounce both sounds distinctly. For example, *palla* (ball) has a stronger /ll/ than *pala* (shovel).  
- **Vowels**: Italian vowels are consistent and always pronounced. Compare this to English, where vowels can have multiple sounds.  
- **R**: Roll it for the classic Italian flair! Practice with words like *rosso* or *arrivederci*.  

Enjoy practicing the Italian alphabet, and remember: *a, bi, ciâ€¦ sei pronto?* (*a, b, câ€¦ are you ready?*) ðŸ˜Š
