### Pronunciation Tips

- **Double consonants**: Pronounce both sounds distinctly. For example, *palla* (ball) has a stronger /ll/ than *pala* (shovel).  
- **Vowels**: Italian vowels are consistent and always pronounced. Compare this to English, where vowels can have multiple sounds.  
- **R**: Roll it for the classic Italian flair! Practice with words like *rosso* or *arrivederci*.
